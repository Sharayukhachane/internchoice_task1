        <h2>Welcome to the Mountains, Let's Climb Big! </h2>
        <p>
            If you're climbing the ladder of life, you go rung by rung, one step at a time. Don't look too far up, set your goals high but take one step at a time.Sometimes you don't think you're progressing until you step back and see how high you've really gone. 
            Climbing mountains will teach you patience, persistence and gratitude. Mountain climbing can be physically and mentally exhausting. But when you reach the top, any roadblocks or struggles you may have had along the way fade and make room for a deep sense of accomplishment.
